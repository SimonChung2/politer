Politer is a web application that allows users to make their statements or messages more polite. It employs the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to enhance and refine text input for a more courteous and considerate output.

This HTML structure defines the basic layout of the web page, including the form where users can input text and a div to display the more polite output.

## JavaScript Functionality

Here's an overview of how it works:

The JavaScript code in the script.js fuke sets up an event handler for the form submission. When the form is submitted, it sends the user's input to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model, which then generates a more polite version of the input. The result is displayed in the output div on the web page.

## Usage

To use the Politer web application, follow these steps:

Enter a less polite statement or text into the input box.
Click the "Make More Polite" button.
The web application will send your input to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model and display a more polite version of the input in the output div.

## For Devs

If you want to use the application yourself, you will need to get your own API key from OpenAI.
